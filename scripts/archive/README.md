# Archived Scripts

This directory contains 122 shell scripts that were previously in the project root. These scripts appear to be development/deployment scripts for various features and fixes.

## Organization

All `.sh` files have been moved here from the project root to clean up the repository structure.

## Note

If you need to reference or run any of these scripts, they are preserved here. However, it's recommended to:
- Review if these scripts are still needed
- Consider consolidating or removing outdated scripts
- Document any scripts that are still actively used
